# HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
* [Portfolio Site](https://Waderjohnson.github.io/)
* [Disney World Travel Site](https://github.com/Waderjohnson/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website)
* [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/Waderjohnson/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project)
### Portfolio Site
This page is a customized portfolio site containing information about me and a link to my GitHub page. It is styled with CSS and contains a navbar with animation effects, a background video, three rows of two columns with containers for images and text. It utilizes a form with inputs set to be emailed to my personal email address.

### Disney World Travel Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled with CSS, and it features a navbar fixed to the top of the page, an image gallery, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site
This page was a project where I was given an image of what the "Showtimes" section was supposed to look like and was asked to use Bootstrap4 to get the webpage to match.
